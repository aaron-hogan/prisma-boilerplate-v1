# JWT Claim Refresh Solution

## Problem Summary

The application had a critical issue where member tabs would disappear after a user purchased a membership or logged in with an existing membership. This happened because:

1. JWT claims weren't being properly refreshed after role changes
2. State management in the dashboard component was complex and unreliable
3. Multiple redirect mechanisms and session flags created race conditions 
4. Next.js 15 async parameter handling wasn't properly implemented

## Solution: Simplified Implementation

Our solution takes a clean, simplified approach that eliminates the complex special redirect mechanism and reduces state management complexity while maintaining all functionality.

### Key Components

1. **Simplified Supabase Clients**
   - `simplified-client.ts` - Streamlined browser client
   - `simplified-server.ts` - Clean server-side client with async cookies
   - `simplified-middleware.ts` - Middleware-specific client with proper response handling

2. **Direct API Endpoints**
   - `/api/auth/refresh` - Dedicated endpoint for JWT claim refreshing
   - `/api/user-data` - API to fetch fresh user data from the database

3. **Streamlined Components**
   - `simplified-dashboard.tsx` - Clean dashboard implementation with straightforward state management
   - `user-simplified/page.tsx` - Server component with proper Next.js 15 parameter handling
   - `products-simplified/page.tsx` - Clean products page with direct action integration

4. **Direct Role-Based Auth**
   - `middleware-simplified.ts` - Role-based protection using JWT claims directly
   - `actions-simplified.ts` - Clean server actions with explicit JWT claim updates

### Implementation Details

#### 1. JWT Refresh

The new implementation directly updates JWT claims after role changes and refreshes the session explicitly:

```typescript
// Update JWT claims directly
await supabase.auth.updateUser({
  data: { app_role: 'MEMBER' }
});

// Explicitly refresh the session to get new claims
await supabase.auth.refreshSession();
```

#### 2. Clean State Management

The dashboard component now has minimal state and relies on server-provided role information:

```typescript
// Check role from profile data
const isMember = ["MEMBER", "STAFF", "ADMIN"].includes(userData.profile.appRole);

// Only show member tab if user has the role
{isMember && (
  <button
    onClick={() => setTab("member")}
    className={`py-2 px-4 border-b-2 ${tab === "member" ? "..." : "..."}`}
  >
    Member Area
  </button>
)}
```

#### 3. Fresh Data Fetching

The dashboard fetches fresh data on mount to ensure it has the latest user information:

```typescript
// Fetch fresh user data once on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const refreshUserData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/user-data');
    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      setUserData(data);
      setPurchases(data.purchases);
    }
  };

  refreshUserData();
}, []);
```

## Testing the Solution

1. **Membership Purchase Flow**
   - Purchase a membership from `/products-simplified`
   - Verify immediate redirect to dashboard with member tab visible
   - Verify member tab remains visible after refresh

2. **Login Flow**
   - Log out and log back in with a member account
   - Verify member tab is visible immediately after login
   - Refresh the page to verify tab remains visible

3. **Membership Cancellation**
   - Cancel a membership from the purchases tab
   - Verify the member tab disappears immediately
   - Log out and log back in to verify member tab remains hidden

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reliability**: Eliminating complex redirects and session flags makes the implementation more predictable
2. **Simplicity**: Cleaner code with less state management is easier to maintain
3. **Performance**: Fewer redirects and state changes mean better UX
4. **Compatibility**: Proper async handling works correctly with Next.js 15

## Migration Path

This implementation preserves all existing functionality while offering a more reliable alternative. The existing implementation remains functional, allowing for gradual migration to the new approach.

To fully migrate:
1. Replace existing Supabase clients with simplified versions
2. Update the middleware to the simplified version
3. Replace client components with the simplified dashboard
4. Update server actions with the simplified implementation
5. Remove the special-redirect mechanism
